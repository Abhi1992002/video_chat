## About 

- This is a video call application (uses same design as google meet), created using WebRTC, HTML, CSS, and JS. This is based on mesh architecture not SFU, so it can't handle many users. 📹🔗

- Currently building a new version of this application using the latest tech stacks. You can see it [here](https://github.com/Abhi1992002/video_call_advanced). 🚀

- I am using websockets for signaling servers here. 🌐

- This project does have functionality of chat as well, but I am not storing anything in the database. 💬🚫
